## About The Project
This project, Backpack Bazaar, is an extension of a group project I worked on previously -> https://github.com/bennettbDEV/CollegeMarketplace. The goal of this project will be to: 
- Refactor the backend to use Django's ORM, which will be faster and more reliable
- Add more customization options
- Implement automatic listing classification using AI/ML
- Develop an algorithm/method to provide suggested/recommended listings to users
